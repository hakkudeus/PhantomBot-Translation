# PhantomBot-Translation

This is a PhantomBot unofficial localization project. It's based on my previous project "PhantomBot-RUS" which was abandoned and then being locked on my lost account (forked from it).

## Progress

Original project had a 80% translated webpanel. Since then it had JS scripts, console and installator planned.

### Current Progress:

- [ ] Localized Webpanel *(Text only)*

- [ ] Localized Chatbot *(Responses in chat)*

- [ ] Localized JS Scripts *(Buttons, Inputs, other in webpanel)*

- [ ] Localized Console *(Errors, Notices)*

- [ ] Localized Installator *(Same console thing)*

Actual as of version: **COMING SOON (c) ** (Date of release here)

### 	Latest version contains:

- scripts/lang/**\*lang_name\*** - Localized Chatbot

- web - Localized Webpanel and JS Scripts

## Languages

As the name says, the project has multiple languages, but please keep in mind: *only one localization can be held on one client*. It's because different localizations might have different progress and a mix might appear.

### Planned Languages:

- [x] ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russian (70%), by @hakkudeus

- [ ] ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukrainian (0%), by @hakkudeus

Other.

## Requirements

**(Outdated)** For a forked release 1.2, [PhantomBot](https://github.com/PhantomBot/PhantomBot) is required, atleast v.3.4.2 (Windows) for a stable work.

All you have to do is unpack the zip file from releases to the bot's root folder, where launch.bat is located (or use installer and choose the same folder).

## Download

You can download latest version at the releases page (soon).
